However, high-quality code comments are often unavailable in smart contracts, the increasingly popular programs that run on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal Transformer-based (MMTrans) code summarization approach for smart contracts. Specifically, the MMTrans learns the representation of source code from the two heterogeneous modalities of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), i.e., Structure-based Traversal (SBT) sequences and graphs. The SBT sequence provides the global semantic information of AST, while the graph convolution focuses on the local details. The MMTrans uses two encoders to extract both global and local semantic information from the two modalities respectively, and then uses a joint decoder to generate code comments. Both the encoders and the decoder employ the multi-head attention structure of the Transformer to enhance the ability to capture the long-range dependencies between code tokens. We build a dataset with over 300K <method, comment> pairs of smart contracts, and evaluate the MMTrans on it. The experimental results demonstrate that the MMTrans outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics by a substantial margin, and can generate higher quality comments.</details>|

COVID-19 pandemic has neither clinically proven vaccine nor drugs so far. It is now obvious that the world is in dire need for non-clinical, real-time, faster and cost-effective and secure smart solutions for monitoring, contact tracing, and diagnosing/detecting COVID-19 patients and hence mitigating the burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, Machine learning approaches can be leveraged in all aspects that could impact the patients and the future care guidelines. However, ensuring the data privacy, security and the conformity to data protection regulations will become even more of a challenge. This leads to the requirement for secured and privacy-preserving machine learning mechanisms for COVID-19-based healthcare applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based privacy-preserving support vector machine (SVM) classification over vertically partitioned IoMT data for a clinical decision support (CDS) system. The proposed system does not require any intervention or direct interactions between data owners. Both local training and building the global classification model run on verifiable and private smart contracts rather than relying on untrusted third parties. We find that the proposed system is more secure and efficient.</details>|

Given the recent growth of Ethereum, the cryptocurrency community and researchers are interested in understanding the Ethereum transactions behavior. In this work, we investigate a key aspect of Ethereum: the prediction of a transaction confirmation or failure based on its features. This is a challenging issue due to the small, but still relevant, fraction of failures in millions of recorded transactions and the complexity of the distributed mechanism to execute transactions in Ethereum. To conduct this investigation, we train machine learning models for this prediction, taking into consideration carefully balanced sets of confirmed and failed transactions. The results show high-performance models for classification of transactions with the best values of F1-score and area under the ROC curve approximately equal to 0.67 and 0.87, respectively. Also, we identified the gas used as the most relevant feature for the prediction.</details>|

Unfortunately, benefiting from its anonymity and immutability, scammers deploy various traps in smart contracts to exploit other participants and seize illegal proceeds. To identify smart Ponzi contracts-a classic fraud widely popular on Ethereum, previous studies present several machine learning-based models with considerable accuracy. However, the performance of their models relies on the behavioral features of smart contracts to a large margin, which are extracted from the transaction records only after a contract has been running for some time. In this paper, we borrow ideas from text feature extraction from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a classification model based on an improved CatBoost algorithm. A novel feature extraction pattern is applied in our model to deeply mine the logic of smart contract code. This approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes at deployment time with improved performance, and thus can avoid the loss of investors originally.</details>|

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which is labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contract for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with expert patterns to yield a final detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in two platforms. Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</details>|

A very large number of smart contracts has been deployed on Ethereum. Meanwhile, security flaws of contracts have led to huge pecuniary losses and destroyed the ecological stability of contract layer on Blockchain. It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue to effectively and efficiently detect vulnerabilities in contracts. Existing detection methods like Oyente and Securify are mainly based on symbolic execution or analysis. These methods are very time-consuming, as the symbolic execution requires the exploration of all executable paths or the analysis of dependency graphs in a contract. In this work, we propose ContractWard to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts with machine learning techniques. First, we extract bigram features from simplified operation codes of smart contracts. Second, we employ five machine learning algorithms and two sampling algorithms to build the models. ContractWard is evaluated with 49502 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ContractWard. The predictive Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 of ContractWard are over 96% and the average detection time is 4 seconds on each smart contract when we use XGBoost for training the models and SMOTETomek for balancing the training sets.</details>|

The novelty of our framework is that it relies only on transaction metadata and balance data from the blockchain system; our approach requires no domain knowledge, code instrumentation, or special execution environment. Dynamit extracts features from transaction data and uses a machine learning model to classify transactions as benign or harmful. Therefore, not only can we find the contracts that are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, but we also get an execution trace that reproduces the attack. Using a random forest classifier, our model achieved more than 90 percent accuracy on 105 transactions, showing the potential of our technique.</details>|

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484813</details>|<details><summary>abstract</summary>Symbolic execution is a powerful technique that can generate tests steering program execution into desired paths. However, the scalability of symbolic execution is often limited by path explosion, i.e., the number of symbolic states representing the paths under exploration quickly explodes as execution goes on. Therefore, the effectiveness of symbolic execution engines hinges on the ability to select and explore the right symbolic states.In this work, we propose a novel learning-based strategy, called Learch, able to effectively select promising states for symbolic execution to tackle the path explosion problem. Learch directly estimates the contribution of each state towards the goal of maximizing coverage within a time budget, as opposed to relying on manually crafted heuristics based on simple statistics as a crude proxy for the objective. Moreover, Learch leverages existing heuristics in training data generation and feature extraction, and can thus benefit from any new expert-designed heuristics. We instantiated Learch in KLEE, a widely adopted symbolic execution engine. We evaluated Learch on a diverse set of programs, showing that Learch is practically effective: it covers more code and detects more security violations than existing manual heuristics, as well as combinations of those heuristics. We also show that using tests generated by Learch as initial fuzzing seeds enables the popular fuzzer AFL to find more paths and security violations.</details>|

SADPonzi: Detecting and Characterizing Ponzi Schemes in Ethereum Smart Contracts. <i>Proc. ACM Meas. Anal. Comput. Syst.</i> 5, 2, Article 26 (June 2021), 30 pages. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3460093</details>|<details><summary>abstract</summary>Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes, i.e., either based on the operation codes (opcodes) of the smart contract binaries or the transaction patterns of addresses. However, state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability and high false positive rates. Moreover, machine-learning based methods are susceptible to evasion techniques, and transaction-based techniques do not work on smart contracts that have a small number of transactions. These limitations render existing methods for detecting Ponzi schemes ineffective. In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, by strictly following the definition of Ponzi schemes, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to first generate the semantic information for each feasible path in smart contracts and then identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.</details>|

Kshetri, "Smart Contracts: Some Practical Considerations" in IT Professional, vol. 23, no. 04, pp. 115-118, 2021.</details>|<details><summary>abstract</summary>When parties involved in a transaction have a comprehensive and clear picture of their businesses and operational practices and have access to reliable data, thereal value can be created using smart contracts. Industrial sectors, for instance, Industrial Internet-of-Things platforms can capture data from a wide arrayof sources and post to the blocks of a distributed ledger. By improving the quality of data, parties involvedin a contract can reduce litigious risks and costs. Under the current regulatory regimes, blockchain-based standalone smart contracts, however, lack thekey elements of a contract, which may create legal uncertainty about how courts and tribunals will inter-pret and enforce such contracts. If concerns relatedto technical infeasibility and economic impracticality are addressed, a mid-level solution would be to use smart contract as a part of a valid and binding natural language contract. In such cases, one or more clausesof a natural language contract are translated into a computer code and published to the blockchain.</details>|

On the other hand, lack of transparency in DNNs makes them unreliable. To ensure transparency in DNN models, it's necessary that model validators can verify the entire learning process and convince third parties with limited resource that the given model is correctly generated. For this purpose, we propose a smart contract that is based on the dispute resolution protocol for verifying DNN model generation process. We divide the entire learning process into layer-based computations. The necessary data for validating each computation, such as the outputs of neurons, weights between layers and their gradients, are uniquely determined by the one-way hash function and the hashes are combined by multiple structured Merkle trees. This enables an honest validator to make a proof that asserts the target model is incorrectly generated, and third parties can check whether the assertion is true by only performing the given computation. Finally, to reveal how our proposal affects the performance degradation during the training, we evaluated running time for deep learning that enables our proofs. This result shows that our proposal can be applied into real applications.

Meanwhile, various vulnerabilities in smart contracts have been exploited by attackers to steal cryptocurrencies worth millions of dollars. The automatic detection of smart contract vulnerabilities therefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem particularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to detect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be ignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this study, to overcome such challenges, we propose the VSCL framework to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically, first, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of smart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in public. Next, the collected vectors are fed into our novel metric learning-based deep neural network(DNN) to get the detection result. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a large-scale benchmark, and the quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</details>|

Despite the ubiquity of these traces universally in almost all computer systems, they are rarely exploited because they are not readily machine-parsable. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agents approach for prediction process using Blockchain technology, which allows automatically analysis of execution traces and detects early warning signals for system failure prediction during executing. The proposed prediction approach is constructed using a four-layer Multi-Agents system architecture. The proposed prediction approach performance is based on data prepossessing and supervised learning algorithms for prediction. Blockchain was used to coordinate collaboration between agents, and to synchronize prediction between agents and the administrators.

Because smart contract platforms typically support Turing-complete programming languages, such systems are often said to enable arbitrary applications. However, the current permissionless smart contract systems impose heavy restrictions on the types of computations that can be implemented. For example, the globally-replicated and sequential execution model of Ethereum requires low gas limits that make many computations infeasible.In this paper, we propose a novel system called ACE whose main goal is to enable more complex smart contracts on permissionless blockchains. ACE is based on an off-chain execution model where the contract issuers appoint a set of service providers to execute the contract code independent from the consensus layer. The primary advantage of ACE over previous solutions is that it allows one contract to safely call another contract that is executed by a different set of service providers. Thus, ACE is the first solution to enable off-chain execution of interactive smart contracts with flexible trust assumptions. Our evaluation shows that ACE enables several orders of magnitude more complex smart contracts than standard Ethereum.</details>|

In particular, we propose a notion of behavioral refinement, which implies inheritance of functional properties. Furthermore, we propose an automated approach to inductive proof, by synthesizing simulation relations on the states of related contracts. Empirically, we demonstrate that behavioral simulations can be synthesized automatically for several ubiquitous classes like tokens, auctions, and escrow, thus enabling the verification of unannotated contracts against functional specifications.},</details>|

This amplifies the difficulties of DoS/DDoS detection. Thus, precautions against DoS/DDoS attack in 5G are of great importance. in this article, we present a solution based on smart contracts and machine learning as a countermeasure against DoS/DDoS attacks in the 5G background by hiding a protected server in a blockchain network and flexibly restricting the scale of DoS/DDoS via transaction fees. We also leverage non-repudiation of smart contracts, analyzing users' malicious behavior of communication and executing punishment via smart contracts. Our scheme could effectively mitigate massive DoS/DDoS attacks in advance and dynamically punitively charge DoS/DDoS attacks. Compared to existing DoS/DDoS defense in 4G, our scheme offers numerous benefits, including making benign communication always dominate rational users and countering DoS/DDoS attacks before they are launched. Moreover, compared to common DoS/DDoS detection based on Ai, we consider the source trustworthiness of training samples and take measures to avoid backdoors where model trainers may compromise Ai models to launch DoS/DDoS attacks.</details>|

Smart contracts have the potential to vastly improve the efficiency and security of traditional contracts through their self-executing autonomy. To realize smart contracts several blockchain-based ecosystems exist. Today a prominent representative is Ethereum. Its programming language Solidity is used to capture and express contractual clauses in the form of code. However, due to the conceptual discrepancy between contractual clauses and corresponding code, it is hard for domain stakeholders to easily understand contracts, and for developers to write code efficiently without errors. Our research addresses these issues by the design and study of a domain-specific smart contract language based on higher level of abstraction that can be automatically transformed to an implementation. In particular, we propose a clause grammar close to natural language, helpful coding abstractions, and the automatic integration of commonly occurring design patterns during code generation. Through these measures, our approach can reduce the design complexity leading to an increased comprehensibility and reduced error susceptibility. Several implementations of exemplary smart contract scenarios, mostly taken from the Solidity documentation, are used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.</details>|

Unfortunately, some malicious users also find the opportunity to use fraudulent means to profit. A new reported approach is to lure new users or other attackers into the contract in an attempt to make a profit by exposing seemingly obvious flaws in the contract. But in fact, the contract contains a hidden trap that ultimately benefits the creator of the contract. Such contracts are known as honeypot contracts in the blockchain ecosystem. Previous studies proposed two methods to identify such smart contracts by using symbolic execution and contract behaviors. However, these methods either make it difficult to discover new categories or fail to warn users before they lose money. To solve this problem, we propose a machine learning model to detect honeypot contracts based on N-gram features and LightGBM. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model performs well in different conditions.</details>|

However, data island and computing resources limitations in the centralized AI architectures have increased their technical barriers, and thus distributed AI collaboration in data, models and resources has attracted intensive research interests. Since the existing trust-based collaboration models are no longer applicable for the large-scale distributed collaboration among trustless machines in open and dynamic environments, this paper proposes a novel decentralized AI collaboration framework, i.e., Learning Markets (LM), in which blockchain provides a trustless environment for collaboration and transaction, while smart contracts serve as software-defined agents to encapsulate and process scalable collaboration relationships and market mechanisms. LM can not only help those participants without mutual trust realize collaborative mining with dynamic and quantitative rewards, but also build an AI market with natural auditability and traceability for trading trusted and verified models. We implement and comprehensively analyze LM based on the Ethereum and IPFS platform, and the results prove that it has advantages in collaboration fairness, transparency, security, decentralization and universality. Based on our collaboration framework, distributed AI contributors are expected to cooperate and complete those learning tasks that cannot be done previously due to lack of complete data, sufficient computing resources and state-of-the-art models.</details>|

To accurately detect these bugs, the developer must use several state-of-the-art bug detection tools and investigate the potential bugs they report. In this study, we first show that one tool is not enough to detect all the bugs as our Static Analysis for Solidity tool (SA-Solidity) and the known SmartCheck and Securify tools identify different bugs in SmartEmbed's experimental set of smart contracts. Then, we develop Machine Learning-based Bug Predictor for Solidity (MLBP-Solidity) which predicts files that would be reported by all the previous bug detection tools. MLBP-Solidity eases the burden on the developer by allowing him/her to focus on a subset of files that are most probably buggy. Our experimental results show that MLBP-Solidity achieves 91-99% accuracy, depending on the type of predicted bug.</details>|

However, less than 1% of deployed smart contracts are open-source, and it is difficult for users to understand the functionality and internal mechanism of those closed-source contracts. Although a few decompilers for smart contracts have been recently proposed, it is still not easy for users to grasp the semantic information of the contract, not to mention the potential misleading due to decompilation errors. In this paper, we propose the first system named Stan to generate descriptions for the bytecodes of smart contracts to help users comprehend them. In particular, for each interface in a smart contract, Stan can generate four categories of descriptions, including functionality description, usage description, behavior description, and payment description, by leveraging symbolic execution and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. Extensive experiments show that Stan can generate adequate, accurate and readable descriptions for contract's bytecodes, which have practical value for users.</details>|

Researchers have embarked on efforts with logic rules, symbolic analysis, and formal analysis to achieve encouraging results in smart contract vulnerability detection tasks. However, the existing detection tools are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we attempt to utilize the deep learning-based approach, namely bidirectional long-short term memory with attention mechanism (BLSTM-ATT), aiming to precisely detect reentrancy bugs. Furthermore, we propose contract snippet representations for smart contracts, which contributes to capturing essential semantic information and control flow dependencies. Our extensive experimental studies on over 42,000 real-world smart contracts show that our proposed model and contract snippet representations significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. In addition, this work proves that it is practical to apply deep learning-based technology on smart contract vulnerability detection, which is able to promote future research towards this area.</details>|

Unlike general programs, the computations of contracts on Ethereum are restricted by the gas limit. If a transaction runs out of the gas limit before an execution finishes, the Ethereum virtual machine throws an out-of-gas exception, and the entire transaction fails, which reverts to the state before the transaction started, although the transaction fee is still deducted. It is therefore, essential to conduct a gas estimation before sending a transaction. Existing studies have mostly failed in estimating the gas for a loop function because the number of iterations of the loops cannot be statically determined. However, we found that a quarter of all contracts have loop functions, and the gas cost for the loops is higher than for the other functions. Therefore, it is necessary to apply a gas estimation for the loop functions. In this study, we propose a gas estimation approach based on the transaction trace to dynamically estimate the gas for the loop functions. Our belief is that we can learn the relationship between the historical transaction traces and their gas costs to estimate the gas for new transactions. We considered three different abstractions of the original transaction trace and fed them to different machine learning models. The results show that our approach is effective in gas estimation and that a random forest can achieve the most accurate estimation.</details>|

However, many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which raises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability.In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep learning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone ratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software. We collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of common vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. (2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the approach in a web-based tool, named SmartEmbed, to facilitate Solidity developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum blockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs. which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract. We optimize the implementations of SmartEmbed which is sufficient in supporting developers in real-time for practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem as well as the individual Solidity developer can both benefit from our research.SmartEmbed website: http://www.smartembed.toolsDemo video: https://youtu.be/o9ylyOpYFq8Replication package: https://github.com/beyondacm/SmartEmbed},</details>|

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3320269.3384756</details>|<details><summary>abstract</summary>In recent years, smart contracts have suffered major exploits, cost- ing millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority fails to protect vulnera- ble contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack. In this work, we introduce \AE{}GIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing attack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the blockchain. We compare \AE{}GIS to current state-of-the-art tools and demonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks. Finally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, thereby confirming the occurrences of well reported and yet unreported attacks in the wild.</details>|

Since each smart contract is a computer program that autonomously runs on a blockchain platform, their development requires much effort and care compared with the development of more common programs. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate a smart contract from a human-understandable contract document that is created using a document template and a controlled natural language (CNL). The automation is based on a mapping from the document template and the CNL to a formal model that can define the terms and conditions in a contract including temporal constraints and procedures. The formal model is then translated into an executable smart contract. We implemented a toolchain that generates smart contracts of Hyperledger Fabric from template-based contract documents via a formal model. We then evaluated the feasibility of our approach through case studies of two types of real-world contracts in different domains.</details>|

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3299815.3314433</details>|<details><summary>abstract</summary>This paper proposes a cloud based public key infrastructure utilizing blockchain technology model for replacing the currently outdated traditional variant. Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.</details>|

Fake footage, images, audios, and videos (known as deepfakes) can be a scary and dangerous phenomenon and can have the potential of altering the truth and eroding trust by giving false reality. Proof of authenticity (PoA) of digital media is critical to help eradicate the epidemic of forged content. Current solutions lack the ability to provide history tracking and provenance of digital media. In this paper, we provide a solution and a general framework using Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track the provenance and history of digital content to its original source even if the digital content is copied multiple times. The smart contract utilizes the hashes of the interplanetary file system (IPFS) used to store digital content and its metadata. Our solution focuses on video content, but the solution framework provided in this paper is generic enough and can be applied to any other form of digital content. Our solution relies on the principle that if the content can be credibly traced to a trusted or reputable source, the content can then be real and authentic. The full code of the smart contract has been made publicly available at Github.</details>|

Fuzzing is fast and scalable, but can be ineffective when it fails to randomly select the right inputs. Symbolic execution is thorough but slow and often does not scale to deep program paths with complex path conditions. In this work, we propose to learn an effective and fast fuzzer from symbolic execution, by phrasing the learning task in the framework of imitation learning. During learning, a symbolic execution expert generates a large number of quality inputs improving coverage on thousands of programs. Then, a fuzzing policy, represented with a suitable architecture of neural networks, is trained on the generated dataset. The learned policy can then be used to fuzz new programs. We instantiate our approach to the problem of fuzzing smart contracts, a domain where contracts often implement similar functionality (facilitating learning) and security is of utmost importance. We present an end-to-end system, ILF (for Imitation Learning based Fuzzer), and an extensive evaluation over &gt;18K contracts. Our results show that ILF is effective: (i) it is fast, generating 148 transactions per second, (ii) it outperforms existing fuzzers (e.g., achieving 33% more coverage), and (iii) it detects more vulnerabilities than existing fuzzing and symbolic execution tools for Ethereum.</details>|

Although smart contracts play these critical roles, it is hard for users interacting with the system to understand the real behavior of the deployed bytecodes of smart contracts. The quirks of smart contracts, such as code reuse and limited unique datasets, make it challenging to recognize the functional details of smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a new method for characterizing bytecode-only smart contracts by automatically assigning multiple attribute tags. Using a deep learning approach, our system, the ScanAT, extracts attribute tags from the source code and metadata of known smart contracts and trains their bytecode with the attribute tags. The ScanAT then infers attribute tags from the bytecode of smart contracts alone. Our experiments show that ScanAT can achieve 81% accuracy in predicting attribute tags, using convolutional neural networks and a customized autoencoder.</details>|

The hosting mode is that the data are completely hosted in the data trading center, so the data trading center retains the data. On the surface, the aggregation mode is that the data trading center is not to retain the data of trading, but actually, it has the ability to retain the data. There is a fundamental difference between the ability to retain the data and the inability to retain the data. These two trading modes cause the data owners to be afraid to share data trading. In this paper, we propose a solution to the data trading mode based on the smart contract using blockchain and machine learning. Our solution takes advantage of the immutability, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain, the programmability of smart contract, and the verification of data availability by the similarity learning to propose a challenge response mechanism between the data purchaser and the data owner, an off-chain download mechanism between the data purchaser and the data storage service provider, and an arbitration mechanism for the controversy resolution of the data trading. The challenge response mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data owner, the off-chain download mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data purchaser to download the purchased data, and the similarity learning is used to deal with the controversy over the data availability in the data trading. The design and implementation of data trading smart contract successfully achieved the goal of removing the trusted third party in the data trading, and thus, the problem that the data trading center has the ability to retain the data in the process of the data trading is solved, as well as the automatic payment by using the Ethereum encrypted currency among the trading participants is realized.

As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give the blockchain a user-defined logical concept. The smart contract is an executable program that can be used for automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO attack resulted in the theft of 60M USD due to unsafe smart contracts. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacking because they are difficult to patch and there is a lack of assessment standards for ensuring their quality. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contracts when they have been published on Ethereum. Thus, this study presents SoliAudit (Solidity Audit), which uses machine learning and fuzz testing for smart contract vulnerability assessment. SoliAudit employs machine learning technology using Solidity machine code as learning features to verify 13 kinds of vulnerabilities, which have been listed as Top 10 threats by an open security organization. We also created a gray-box fuzz testing mechanism, which consists of a fuzzer contract and a simulated blockchain environment for on-line transaction verification. Different from previous research systems, SoliAudit can detect vulnerabilities without expert knowledge or predefined patterns. We subjected SoliAudit to real-world evaluation by using near 18k smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain and Capture-the-Flag samples. The results show that the accuracy of SoliAudit can reach to 90% and the fuzzing can help identify potential weaknesses, including reentrancy and arithmetic overflow problems.</details>|

Therefore, we need 'stronger' smart contracts with flexible structures that are resilient in such unexpected situations. In this paper, we propose a generic mechanism to strengthen smart contracts and handle possible unexpected situations. Given a smart contract, this mechanism automatically generates an action list which offers actions as interfaces to change parameters of smart contracts and a voting system that utilizes a limited voter group randomly chosen from the peers. Each action in the action list can change a corresponding parameter of smart contracts. The actions, when approved by the majority, are executed to change the parameters. When users face unexpected situations in a transaction, they choose some actions as the solution and pass them to the voting system. Since a smart contract has finite parameters, there are finite actions. By arranging and combining these actions, our mechanism offers solutions that can handle wide-ranging unexpected situations. Also, to execute a solution, the majority of voters need to approve it, thus not violating the protocol of the original smart contract. Voters are rewarded based on quadratic rules for peer prediction, which makes telling true preferences the only way to maximize rewards. Using machine learning, we predict users' preferences based on the voting records. The predictions are provided as default values for future votes to avoid users' need to vote manually each time.</details>|

However, the flexibility that everybody can write and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum causes a large collection of similar contracts, i.e., clones. In practice, smart contract clones may amplify severe threats like security attacks, resource waste etc. In this paper, we have developed EClone, a semantic clone detector for Ethereum. The key insight of our clone detection is Symbolic Transaction Sketch, i.e., a set of critical semantic properties generated from symbolic transaction. Sketches of two smart contracts will be normalized into numeric vectors with a same length. Then, the clone detection problem is modeled as a similarity computation process where sketches and other syntactic information are combined. We have applied EClone in identifying semantic clones of deployed Ethereum smart contracts and achieved an accuracy of 93.27%. A demo video of EClone is at https://youtu.be/IRasOVv6vyc.</details>|
